Still yet another snake game
============================

Inspired by [Mary live-codes a JavaScript game from scratch](http://vimeo.com/105955605), I decided to spend my sick leave making another snake game. (See previous at [worm.kakspistenolla.com](http://worm.kakspistenolla.com).) I did spent quite a bit more than 30 minutes, but in my defense, I'm pretty sure Mary had a practise run before her public live coding session.

Playing the game
----------------

A version of the game can be found at [snake.kakspistenolla.com](http://snake.kakspistenolla.com).

The quickest way to test the game (locally) is using [`beefy`](http://didact.us/beefy/). Run `beefy main.js:bundle.js` and point your browser to the address echoed to your console.o
