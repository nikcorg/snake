Still yet another snake game
----------------------------

Inspired by [Mary live-codes a JavaScript game from scratch](http://vimeo.com/105955605), I decided to spend my sick leave by making another snake game. (See previous at [work.kakspistenolla.com](http://worm.kakspistenolla.com).) I did spent quite a bit more than 30 minutes, but in my defense, I'm pretty sure Mary had a practise run before her public live coding session.
